    description: `Nike was founded in 1964 by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman in Oregon, United States. Initially, the company was called Blue Ribbon Sports and focused on distributing athletic shoes imported from Japan. After several years, they began designing and producing their own shoes, with Bowerman famously always trying to innovate shoe designs to improve athlete performance. In 1971, the company officially changed its name to Nike, inspired by the name of the goddess of victory in Greek mythology.`,
